However, before you were supposed to buy a new ship, a mysterious man gave you an offer that will change your life..... (You will only receive the Bactrian H.A.T)"

	"	You were walking to the bank when suddenly a mysterious man approaches you. He was wearing a helmet with a gas mask and a trench coat with some armor underneath it. He appears to be heavily armed since you can see at least one handgun on his utility belt and what looks to be a PDW in his trench coat."
	"	'Hello there, stranger. It appears that you are about to take out a loan to buy a new starship.'"
	"	'How do you know?,' You say as you prepare your laser pistol."
	"	'Lets just say we have eyes and ears everywhere Captain. Any ways, i suggest you put your laser pistol away, there is no need for that. I mean no harm since i am only here to help you.'"
	"	'With what?,' you ask."
	"	'Well, you are about to take out a loan to buy a starship aren't you Captain. We can offer you a better deal captain. Fly for us, explore the galaxy and bring back ships for us to research and we will give you access to our advanced tech, along with a heavily modified Bactrian made to function as a flagship and 1 million credits, although, if you want a challenge i suggest you only use the more advanced tech when you actually need it since it'll be too easy if you use the entire fleet to kill mere pirates.'"

Next you are lead to the outfitter where you can see the outfits that you will be using in the future. Finally, you are lead to the gun store. Inside, there are all sorts of firearms ranging from the small handguns to 50 cal anti material rifles. You know that you will have all the tools needed to complete your mission from now on."
