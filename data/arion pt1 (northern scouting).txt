			`"Good job helping the 11th Transport Squadron. While they probably didn't need help, its good to have backup. Besides, you helped us neutralize the pirate gang, for now. We will need to check on them. You will be joining the 7th Scouting Squadron on Farpoint, and help find their base to determine their strength, meet them in the spaceport," the base commander tells you.`

			`"Hello Captain <first> <last>, my name is Midnight and before you ask, yes that is my codename, not my real name. I am the commander of the 7th scouting squadron. Usually there would be another ship accompanying us but the captain got injured in a recent battle, so you will be my temporary squadmate. Our first task is to scout Haven, a pirate system where the main base of the pirates you recently fight resides. We need to check their strength and how much ships they have left. It will not be easy since we will be the only 2 ships available. But hey, we are only there to scout, not fight."`

			`	"It appears that the amount of larger warships in their arsenal has been reduced. Wether they have been destroyed or out hunting, i don't know. However, seeing as they usually have a few medium and heavy warships in their base, i suspect the former. Anyways, wait a minute......... a few light warships are preparing to take off, we have to go. I'll launch a few missile shots while they're still on the ground, but expect a few enemies to still be able to pursue. Wether we fight or flee, up to you <first>."`

			`You quickly land near the spaceport, the SFF Overseer following quickly behind you. Hopefully, you were able to get some important information.`
			`	"Well <first>, looks like we got some interesting intel, hopefully we get something useful out of it. Like i said while at Haven, it appears we hit em quite hard. While the 11th Transport Squadron sent some reports of pirates attacking their convoys, it appears that they are using less and less Heavy Warships, instead relying more on their Splinters and Ravens. How ever, there are rumors of their second in command beginning to raid again. I'll look over this data for now. You can meet in the spaceport later, maybe i'll have some information by then."`

Lets hope that the amount of the Heavy Warships they have has been reduced. Although, i have a feeling that we will have a tough fight soon. Luckily however, i was able to convince the higher ups to send over the 11th transport squadron."`

			`The 4 of you land near the spaceport, lucky to be alive. While Arion's tech is powerful, being that outnumber is tense, although the addition of the 11th helping you and Midnight probably meant that as long as you didn't do anything stupid, you would win.`
