	description "The X-47 was originally a prototype drone that was made by Northrop Grumman. The blueprints for the drone was then purchased by Arion after experimentation has stopped. It now serves as one of the main drones for the Arion Air Force, Arion Foreign Legion, SFF and other allies to Arion under the designation 'FQ-101'. These drones can be operated as loyal wingman and as a defense system for the 'Arsenal Bird'. Although, this is an earlier version that still has the X-47 designation and is being sold as surplus."

	description "This was an Attacker aircraft used by the US and some of its allies. It has been modified and upgrade extensively not only to survive modern combat but also to fly in space. It is used mainly by the Arion Marine Corps and the Arion Army Air Corps as an attacker and a light fighter. While it isn't the best for A2A roles, its cheapness, ruggedness, maneuverability and ability to take off from almost any road has made it very useful. It is also used in the Arion Air Force, Arion Navy and Arion Foreign Legion mainly as Trainers. It is also very popular with civilians and mercenaries due to its low cost."

	description "An Interceptor aircraft based on the SR-71 made by the Xenonauts, it will defend humanity once more. This time however, it can take the fight to them. It was originally supposed to use singularity missiles but since we don't have access to them here (plus it would be overkill anyways), we have decided to give a bomber hardpoint."
