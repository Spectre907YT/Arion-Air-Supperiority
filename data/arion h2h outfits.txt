It can be used for many threat, but it is usually only used either when there are bio threats or for clearing out enclosed spaces. The MPF-01 Bleach is a powerful weapon, it has 2 gas tanks, one in its stock and another under its handguard, that can be refilled with the pump handle on the handguard tank. The fuel tank located where a magazine would normally go can be replaced with a hose that connects to a backpack filled with fuel and gas, much like normal flamethrowers. The legality of flamethrowers is very questionable so it should be alright to have one, although due to the nature of flamethrowers, they are heavily taxed when sold to non government entities.
