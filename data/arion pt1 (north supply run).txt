			`	"Hello Captain <first> <last>! This is Captain Tod of the SFF Amazon. You will be joining our squadron, the 11th Transport Squadron, for our transport operation. We will be supporting the navy base in Farpoint by bringing in needed supplies while hopefully clearing up some piracy in our way. There is a pirate gang patrolling the area we will be passing through and if they attack, we should disable and board their ships to capture their captain for interrogation. You should definitely capture them if you can since they will definitely have some goodies. Also, remember to take the hyperlane route, we want to make sure that the route is clear! The SFF Wish will also be accompanying us."`

			`"Good job capturing that captain ,<first>!" Tod says to you. "The Navy will be pleased that they will not only be receiving supplies, but also a prisoner to interrogate. Anyways we probably attracted the attention of their leader, so we should be careful when we head back later on."`

			`"Good job taking out their leader <first> <last>! You should definitely check their leaders ship for anything interesting. The northern passage should be safer, for now. Anyways, you should head back to Luna, maybe they have something for you to do. Good luck and goodbye Captain, may our paths cross again," Tod says to you while he returns to his ship.`
