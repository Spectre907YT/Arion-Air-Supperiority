# Arion - Air Superiority
An Endless Sky plugin that adds a variety of things to endless sky, including: 

- Real life fighters
  
- Real life bombers
  
- Ace combat super planes
  
- Xenonauts fighters
  
- A bunch of new H2H weapons based on real life weapons
  
- Advanced outfits
  
- Specialized weapons
  
- Superweapons
  
- Custom ships
  
- Some new missions and jobs
  
- ETC

To get access to some of the content visit Earth, Valhalla, Hephaestus or Bourne. Perhaps helping them out by doing some jobs and mission is a good idea.

There are also some bonus content if you have the midnight, mega freight, czartraks ships or navycampaign plugin. To access the bonus content, move the respective files from the bonus file to the data file.

(Special thanks to 1010todd and yuyuko_saigyouji. from the Endless Sky discord server for letting me borrow some sprites)
