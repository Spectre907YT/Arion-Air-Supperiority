# Endless Sky---Arion
Currently adds a shipyard, outfitter and some real life fighters and bombers to Luna which supplies some tier 1-3+ gear. Also adds some missions.
There are also some bonus content if you have the respective plugins. If you want to use it, move the data from the bonus file to the data file.
