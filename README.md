# Endless Sky---Arion
Currently adds a shipyard, outfitter to Luna which supplies some tier 1-3+ gear, some real life fighters, bombers and 2 ace combat superplanes. Also adds some missions.
There are also some bonus content if you have the respective plugins. If you want to use it, move the data from the bonus file to the data file.
