# Endless Sky---Arion
Adds a bunch of new weapons, outfits, h2h weapons, modified ships, real life fighter jets and bombers, ace combat superplanes and xenonauts fighters, alongside 7 custom ships. To get access to the goodies, visit Earth, Valhalla, Hephaestus or Bourne and do a short "campaign". Or simply finish the main campaign. Or eliminate a lot of enemies.
There are also some bonus content if you have the midnight, mega freight, czartraks ships or navycampaign plugin. To access the bonus content, move the respective files from the bonus file to the data file.
(Special thanks to 1010todd for letting me borrow some sprites)
