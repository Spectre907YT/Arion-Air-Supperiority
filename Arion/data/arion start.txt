However, before you were supposed to buy a new ship, a mysterious man gave you an offer that will change your life..... (You will only receive the Bactrian H.A.T)"

	"	You were walking to the bank when suddenly a mysterious man approaches you. He was wearing a helmet with a gas mask and a trench coat with some armor underneath it. He appears to be heavily armed since you can see at least one handgun on his utility belt and what looks to be a PDW in his trench coat."
	"	'Hello there, stranger. It appears that you are about to take out a loan to buy a new starship.'"
	"	'How do you know?,' You say as you prepare your laser pistol."
	"	'Lets just say we have eyes and ears everywhere Captain. Any ways, i suggest you put your laser pistol away, there is no need for that. I mean no harm since i am only here to help you.'"
	"	'With what?,' you ask."
	"	'Well, you are about to take out a loan to buy a starship aren't you Captain. We can offer you a better deal captain. Fly for us, explore the galaxy and bring back ships for us to research and we will give you access to our advanced tech, along with a heavily modified Bactrian made to function as a flagship and 1 million credits, although, if you want a challenge i suggest you only use the more advanced tech when you actually need it since it'll be too easy if you use the entire fleet to kill mere pirates.'"
